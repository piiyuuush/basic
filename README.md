# BE FE Semester 1 - Basic C Programs

Welcome to the **BE FE Semester 1 - Basic C Programs** repository! This repository contains foundational C programming examples aimed at helping first-year engineering students (Bachelor of Engineering, First Year - Semester 1) understand key concepts in C programming. 

## Overview

This repository covers the essentials of C programming, including:

1. **Input/Output Functions**  
   Learn how to handle user input and display output in C.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**  
   Understand basic arithmetic calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3. **Branching Statements**  
   Explore decision-making with `if`, `else if`, and `switch` statements to control program flow.

4. **Looping Statements**  
   Discover loops like `for`, `while`, and `do-while` for repetitive tasks.

5. **Iterative Statements**  
   Implement patterns and sequences with iterative approaches.

6. **Patterns Using Iterative Statements**  
   Create different patterns (such as triangles, diamonds, etc.) using loops.

7. **Functions in C**  
   Define reusable code blocks with functions to improve code structure and readability.

8. **Recursive Functions**  
   Understand recursion and implement functions that call themselves.

9. **Arrays in C**  
   Get hands-on with arrays, enabling you to store and manipulate collections of data.

10. **Multidimensional Arrays**  
    Dive deeper with multidimensional arrays to work with tables, matrices, and grids.

11. **Strings**  
    Manipulate text using character arrays, explore string functions, and understand string handling.
